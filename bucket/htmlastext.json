    "description": "HTMLAsText utility converts HTML documents to simple text files, by removing all HTML tags and formatting the text according to your preferences. Features: * HTMLAsText automatically removes all tags and scripts from the document. * The remained text is formatted according to the number of characters per line that you select. * All HTML entities (e.g.: &amp, &lt) are converted into the corresponding ASCII characters. * Unordered lists (<ul> tag) and ordered lists (<ol> tag) are formatted accordingly. The bullets beside the items of unordered lists are replaced by ASCII characters according to your selection. * Definition lists are formatted by adding spaces in the left side of the definition lines. * Optionally, centered and right-aligned paragraphs are formatted accordingly by adding space characters in the left side of the lines. * Optionally, HTMLAsText allows you to add a line under each heading (<h1> - <h6> tags) * Simple tables can be delimited by spaces, tab characters, commas, or CRLF. * Preformatted text blocks (<pre> tag) are copied \"as is\", without formatting the text. * You can convert multiple HTML files in the same folder at once, by using wildcard. (e.g.: c:\\files\\*.html) * You can run the conversion process without displaying any user interface, by using the /run command-line option.",
