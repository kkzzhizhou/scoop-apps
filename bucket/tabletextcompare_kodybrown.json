    "description": "TableTextCompare is a small utility that allows you to easily compare 2 tab-delimited or comma-delimited (csv) files, and find out the difference between the 2 files. You can use this tool for comparing 2 different snapshots of data, created by other NirSoft utilities, like DriverView, ServiWin, USBDeview, CurrPorts, WirelessNetView, ShellExView, and many others... For example, You can use DriverView utility to save 2 snapshots of loaded drivers list into a tab-delimited file, and then use TableTextCompare to easily find out which device drivers were added, removed, or changed since the time that the first snapshot was taken. TableTextCompare can make the comparison even if the records of the 2 files are not sorted in the same order, or if the fields are not positioned in the same order.",
