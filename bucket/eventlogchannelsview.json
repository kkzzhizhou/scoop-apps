    "description": "EventLogChannelsView is a simple tool for Windows 10/8/7/Vista that shows the list of all event log channels on your system, including the channel name, event log filename, enabled/disabled status, current number of events in the channel, and more... It also allows you to easily make some actions on multiple channels at once: enable/disable channels, set their maximum file size, and clear all events stored in the channels.",
