The system counters include the number of incoming/outgoing bytes, number of incoming/outgoing packets, number of broadcast packets, and more. You can also initialize all counters to zero at any time in order to watch the network counters for specific event. NetworkCountersWatch also calculates and displays the current download speed and upload speed on your network interface.",
