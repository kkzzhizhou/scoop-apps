        "    2.    Click 'Connect' in the GOG Galaxy 2 Integration Settings (This will restart discord in developer mode so the integration can attach a debugger to it)",
        "    3.    Wait until discord has restarted and shows the activity page / a server page",
        "    4.    Click connect and wait until the integration collects all the data it needs (This will open the friends page in discord)"
